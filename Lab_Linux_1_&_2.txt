Lab 1. (Solution)
=================
1. Display your current directory. 
The command is #pwd

2. Change to the /etc directory.
The command is #cd /etc

3. Now change to your home directory using only three key presses. 
The command is #cd or #cd ~

4. Change to the /etc/grub.d  directory using only eleven key presses.
#cd /etc/grub.d 

5. Go to the parent directory of the current directory.
#cd ..      --> this .. means your parent directory. 

6. Go to the root directory.
#cd /    / --> is called the root directory. This stays at the top and all directories reside under this directory.

7. List the contents of the root directory.
#cd / ; ls 

8. List a long listing of the root directory.
#ls -l /

9. Stay where you are, and list the contents of /etc.
#ls /etc  or ls -l /etc

10. Stay where you are, and list the contents of /bin and /sbin.
#ls /bin ; ls /sbin

11. Stay where you are, and list the contents of ~.
#ls -l /root or #ls ~

12. List all the files (including hidden files) in your home directory.
#ls -la

13. List the files in /boot in a human readable format.
#ls -lah

14. Create a directory testdir in your home directory.
#mkdir testdir

15. Change to the /etc directory, stay here and create a directory newdir in your home directory.
#cd /etc 
#mkdir /root/newdir
#mkdir /home/cloud-user/newdir

16. Create in one command the directories ~/dir1/dir2/dir3 (dir3 is a subdirectory from dir2, and dir2 is a subdirectory from dir1 ).
#mkdir -p /home/cloud-user/dir1/dir2/dir3

17. Remove the directory testdir.
#rmdir testdir
